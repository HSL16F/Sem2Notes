There are various design patterns covered in SMD used to improve simplicity and effectiveness and ease maintainability
- [[Domain Models]]
- [[System Sequence Diagrams]]


Domain model captures concepts, attributes and associations of the design and acts as a visual dictionary of noteworthy abstractions, domain vocav and information content of the domain
SSD captures sequence of systems of one scenario in use cases, it provides a dynamic context of the system, how actors interact with the blackbox system and how the system responds.
Domain Models and SSD's *should* be abstract and provide only essential context and information with the purpose of assisting in understanding the domain.
