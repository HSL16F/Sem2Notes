Avoiding unnecessary coupling (joining) of different elements that rely on each other.
Low Coupling: Each element not dependent on many other elements
High Coupling: Isolation is difficult, reuse harder and small changes affect many other things
Coupling can be done both in the design models and sequence diagrams for example.
It is an evaluative principle across *all* design decisions. High Coupling can be ok for stable and well understood design elements, though this is more so an exception than the norm.
