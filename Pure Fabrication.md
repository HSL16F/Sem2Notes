Method of assigning responsibility without violating high cohesion and low coupling. It is a cohesive set of responsibilities to an artificial class that is not present in the original domain.
Pure Fabrication is closely related to indirection.
Indirection: Any classes which are assigned as intermediaries
Pure Fabrication: Artificial class acts as the intermediary
Overuse can lead to too much responsibility of one class and therefore low cohesion.
