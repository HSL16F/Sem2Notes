Designing objects such that the systems and subsystem such that variations or instability of elements do not affect that of others. Change such as variation point (Changes to existing system or requirements) and evolution point (Speculative variations which may arise in the future).
Identify points of instability and assign responsibilities to create a stable interface/object to access the more instable variants.
Protected Variants very important and related to many critical patterns. Essentially the open closes principle. Open to extension (adaptable) but closed for modification. Similar to polymorphism in the sense that is it can be cheaper or easier to rework a simple design then future proof everything, still it holds great utility.
