A series of design patterns, some of the GoF patterns include:
- [[Fa√ßade]]
- [[Decorator]]
- [[Builder]]
- [[Adapter]]
- [[Factory]]
- [[Singleton]]
There are 23 GoF design patterns in total, though most are not focus of course.
Adapter provides different interface to its subject. Decorator provides enhanced interface.
Composite and Decorator have similar structure, both rely on recursive composition to organise open-ended number of objects.
Composite, unlike decorator is not focused on embellishment, but on representation. These intents are distinct but act to compliment each other. Composite and decorator often used together.
Decorator changes the skin of an object, the outside overview, strategy changes the fundamental actions.
Template method and strategy both solve problem of separating generic algorithm with detailed one.
Template method employs inheritance whilst strategy employs delegation.
Most subclasses call methods from superclass, but in template, superclass calls methods from template.
Calling strategy does not always involve structures process as like in template method.
