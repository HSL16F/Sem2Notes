Used for handling different types of data, software components etc. Essentially, more adaptable and pliable. Assign responsibility for behaviour using polymorphic operations to types of behaviour varies. Polymorphic operations are operations with the same interface, using conditional logic is not an appropriate method for behaviour of alternative types.
Polymorphism is important to how systems handle variations of similar objects and problems.
Designing systems with interfaces and polymorphism for possible future proofing is useful, though is a balance between too much work for cases that may nor arise and genuine useful cases.
